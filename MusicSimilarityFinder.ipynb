        "In this project, I built a small Music Similarity Finder that can compare songs and recommend tracks that sound alike. I used a collection of MP3 files, extracted basic audio features (MFCC, brightness, chroma, tempo), and turned each song into a numerical feature vector. Then, using cosine similarity, the system measures how close two songs are based on these features.\n",
        "\n",
        "I also created a simple Gradio interface where the user can pick a track, listen to it, see its waveform and spectrogram, and view the top similar songs. The UI also shows a bar chart with similarity scores, which makes the results easy to read and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "All validation tests showed that the system works consistently:\n",
        "it returns good results, avoids recommending the same song, and produces logical similarity rankings.\n",
